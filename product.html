					    <header class="articleheader">Heart Monitor Training</header>
						    <p class="paragraph">
                                Instead of training at a specific pace, you use a heart-rate monitor to train at a specific effort level for a set amount of time.
                                The idea behind heart rate-based training is that you train your aerobic system without overstressing your skeletal and muscular systems, explains personal trainer Erin Carr. 
                                It is a different way to be successful at running, she says. It does not have to be no pain, no gain, or going as hard as you possibly can, and it allows for continued improvements over time.

					    <header class="articleheader">How to find your heart-rate training zones?</header>
						    <p class="paragraph">
                                There are many different formulas that you can use to calculate your maximum heart rate (MHR) and find your personal heart-rate training zones. The easiest way is by using
                                an age-based equation, these are straightforward and easy to work with, as they offer a general guideline. The most common rule is simply 220 minus your age, so a 40-year-old 
                                would have a theoretical MHR of 180.

					    <header class="articleheader">What are the benefits of heart rate training?</header>
						    <p class="paragraph">
                                Heart-rate training prevents you from running too hard on your easy or recovery runs, reducing the risk of fatigue and overtraining; it also helps you to recover. 
                                By recovering properly during your easy runs, your legs will also be fresher for your next hard session or race. Equally, you will be able to accurately track your 
                                effort in interval sessions, when you want to be working at a higher intensity.

                <article class = "article item4">
					    <header class="articleheader">Recovery Heart Rate</header>
						    <p class="paragraph">
                                This is the amount of time it takes for your heart rate to return to its resting heart rate after vigorous exercise. It is similar to resting heart rate in that, 
                                if it improves (recovery time shortens), that is a sign that your fitness is also improving. If your HRM measures this (not all of them do), then keep an eye on it to see if it improves over time.
						    </p>

                <article class = "article item5">
					    <header class="articleheader">HR Max (Maximum Heart Rate)</header>
						    <p class="paragraph">
                                This is the absolute fastest rate at which your heart is able to beat. It is also the key spec for setting up your personal training program. Not all HRMs measure and display HR max; if yours does not,
                                 then it is a good idea to calculate yours (see below) so that you can set up an exercise program that is precisely synced with your body, age and fitness level.
						    </p>
				</article>
                <article class = "article item6">
					    <header class="articleheader">Heart Rate Training Zones</header>
						    <p class="paragraph">
                                Efficient training plans utilize heart rate training zones, which are calculated in relation to your HR max. One option for working out with your HRM is to simply follow one of its 
                                predefined workout routines without thinking deeply about the underlying heart rate data that your device uses to set up and monitor zones associated with your workout.
